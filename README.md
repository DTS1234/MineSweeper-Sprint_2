# MineSweeper-Sprint_2
This new sprint adds two new features to sprint1.

The following changes are implented in this project :

  - Uncover an initial set of empty squares.
  - Decoupling game rules from user interface, making it possible to play the same game,
    without changes, through different user interfaces.
  - Improve the appearance of console inputs and outputs.
